# Evidence Portal for the Croatian Cybersecurity Act and Regulation

## Description

This project is a lightweight web application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) designed to help organizations demonstrate compliance with the Croatian Cybersecurity Act and its Regulation, aligned with the EU NIS2 Directive.

The application organizes legal and regulatory obligations into a structured catalog (e.g. governance, risk management, incident handling, business continuity, supply chain security, and awareness & training). For each obligation, users can attach and manage compliance evidence such as documents, screenshots, configuration snippets, links, and attestation notes.

Key features include evidence guidance per obligation, coverage and freshness tracking with visual indicators, and export of auditor-ready packages for inspections and audits. The system is intended as an educational project, demonstrating how regulatory requirements can be translated into a practical, structured compliance support tool.
